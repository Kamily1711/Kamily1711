# 👋 Hi there

I'm Kamily, a passionate in the technology environment and a student of graduation in Information System. I'm current studing Python, from myself and with some courses, and some of the advantages of using this language to solve programming problems. I had already had some experiences with another language and I participated to competitions of programming in C++ and a variation of this language in the IDE Arduino. I started to learn algorithms and computer thinking in 2017. 

#  🚀  Expertise
I've been focused in Python since the begining of 2023,and nowadays I'm an advanced in the language and I consider myself a beginer in C++. I liked to learn about python and I could see how coding could be writen very near of the human understanding. I will keep my studies in the language and the frameworks of it. I would like learning about Machine Learinig and Data Science.
